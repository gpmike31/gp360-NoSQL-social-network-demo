# gp360-NoSQL-social-network-demo

With this set up once cloned to your local repository you be able to create, update, and react to various post one would make on a platform such as facebook, twitter, or instagram after initiating a server through npm start from your terminal . Please click on the link below to see a demonstration of the functionality of this app and how it creates these instances through testing the various routes with the Insomnia app.
